## Weather-Forecast-Redux

Starter project developed with React + Redux and two APIs:

- OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve 5-day weather forecast of any city.
- GoogleMap API to show small map of the selected city.

This app allows the user to search and add cities in Spain. The app shows the weather forecast data of these cities for the next 5 days. The data shown is temperature, humidity and pressure.
A small GoogleMap iframe shows the city selected, making the UI more attractive.

### Possible improvements

- API calls using GraphQL to improve the data downloaded from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Backend MongoDB to store the selected cities.
